# tsx-component
A small script to generate a TSX component.

## Usage
```bash
yarn dlx @sportshead/tsx-component
```
The program will prompt you for three things: the name of the component, if the component has state, and if the state is async.
It will then print the file to be written and ask for confirmation.
